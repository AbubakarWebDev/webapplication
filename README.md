Since I have found so many such awesome websites throughout my journey in this vast ocean we call Internet, I would like to share my collection with you all. I hope you will like this cool collection of mine and don't forget to star my repo!

Most of the websites are just for fun and some are very useful for specific purposes. Though I have written brief information about it in front of the link which I hope will grow your curiosity. Enjoy and do share this cool collection with your friends.
